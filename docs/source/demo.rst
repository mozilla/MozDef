Demo Instance
=============

Mozilla maintains a demo instance of MozDef that you can use try out the UI and get a feel for it in a live environment
with test/random data.

Simply browse to http://demo.mozdef.com:3000 and login using any gmail or yahoo email address. No credentials/passwords are
sent to the demo instance, though your email will be logged. If you'd prefer you can also use mozdef@mockmyid.com as a userID which will not prompt for any credentials.
