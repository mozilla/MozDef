# This alert consumes data produced by the MIG sshkey module and mig-runner.
# ssh key related events are compared against a whitelist which is the
# alerts configuration file (sshkey.conf). The format of this whitelist
# is as follows:
#
# <host regex> <path>
#
# If a host matches the regex, and the detected key matches the path, the
# alert will not generate an alert event. If the detected key is not in
# the whitelist, an alert will be created.
