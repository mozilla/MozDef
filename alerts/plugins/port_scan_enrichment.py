class message(object):
    '''Alert plugin that handles messages (alerts) tagged as containing
    information about a port scan having been detected.  This plugin
    will add information to such alerts describing any connections
    successfully established by the IP address from which the port
    scan originates.

    The expected format of the configuration file,
    `port_scan_enrichment.json`, is as such:

    ```json
    {
      "indicesToSearch": [
        "events-weekly"
      ],
      "maxConnections": 32,
      "matchTags": [
        "portscan"
      ],
      "searchWindow": {
        "hours": 12,
        "minutes": 30,
        "seconds": 59
      }
    }
    ```

    `indicesToSearch` is an array of names of indices to search in ES.
    If not provided or else an empty array, it defaults to `["events-weekly"]`.
    `maxConnections` is the maximum number of successful
    connections to list.  If set to 0, all will be listed.
    `matchTags` is a list of tags to match against.  This plugin will
    run against any alert containing any of the specified tags.  If
    `matchTags` is not provided or is an empty array, it will default
    to `["portscan"]`
    The `searchWindow` option is an object containing keyword
    arguments to be passed to Python's `datetime.timedelta` function
    and can thus contain any keys corresponding to the keyword
    arguments that would be passed to the `datetime.datetime` function.
    If `searchWindow` is not present or is an empty object, the
    default search window is 24 hours.

    The modified alert will have a `details.recentconnections` field
    appended to it, formatted like so:

    ```json
    {
      "details": {
        "recentconnections": [
          {
            "destinationipaddress": "1.2.3.4",
            "destinationport": 80,
            "timestamp": "2016-07-13 22:33:31.625443+00:00"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    That is, each connection will be described in an array and be an
    object containing the IP address and port over which the connection
    was established and the time the connection was made.
